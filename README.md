# Emotion Detection Using Deep Learning

## Overview

The Emotion Detection Using Deep Learning project aims to classify emotions from text data using advanced deep learning techniques. This model leverages neural networks to detect and categorize emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more from textual inputs.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Gathers and preprocesses text data labeled with different emotions.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Involves tokenization, stopword removal, and normalization to prepare the text for deep learning models.
- **Feature Extraction**: Uses embeddings such as Word2Vec, GloVe, or contextual embeddings like BERT to convert text into numerical features.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Implements neural network architectures such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformer-based models like BERT for emotion classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assesses model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
